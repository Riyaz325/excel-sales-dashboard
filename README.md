## 💡 Key Business Insights

- Top 5 products = 80% of total sales
- Laptop alone accounts for 26% of revenue
- **Recommendation**: Protect supply chain for these critical SKUs

### 3. **Regional Performance**
- East region leads but only by 10% vs. lowest region
- No region underperforming significantly
- **Recommendation**: Investigate East's success factors for replication

### 4. **Customer Base Analysis**
- Average order value of $1,522 indicates B2B or high-ticket items
- With 8,515 customers and $13M sales, strong repeat purchase behavior
- **Recommendation**: Implement customer retention program

### 5. **Office Supplies Underperformance**
